# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation for creating this is to learn the basics of what we will be doing in Boot Camp.

This project was built to give me an understanding of how a webpage and its elements such as HTML, CSS, GitHub and Javascript work together. 

This solves the basics to what we will be doing and how to debug if it gets down to that.

I learned a lot about using terminal and github on my Macbook, and troubleshot issues that I was having with commands i was to use while doing this project. I feel I have a much better understanding the fundamentals and what is expected of me during this course.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
